That‚Äôs a great project idea üëè ‚Äî essentially, you want to build a job portal system tailored to the Rwandan context, where employers post jobs and employees apply by showcasing their profiles and documents.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how you can structure your system:
________________________________________
üîπ Core Features
1. Authentication (Both Employer & Employee)
‚Ä¢	User Registration (with role selection: Employer / Employee).
‚Ä¢	Secure Login (with email/phone + password, maybe later add 2FA with SMS/Email).
‚Ä¢	Profile management.
________________________________________
2. Employer Side
‚Ä¢	Create/Edit/Delete company profile.
‚Ä¢	Post a job (with fields like: job title, description, requirements, location, salary, deadline).
‚Ä¢	View applicants (list of employees who applied).
‚Ä¢	Shortlist candidates and contact them.
‚Ä¢	Dashboard (statistics: number of jobs posted, applications received, etc.).
________________________________________
3. Employee Side
‚Ä¢	Create/Edit personal profile (basic info, education, skills, work experience).
‚Ä¢	Upload supporting documents (CV, diploma, certificates).
‚Ä¢	Search jobs (by category, location, company, salary range).
‚Ä¢	Apply for jobs (submit profile + documents).
‚Ä¢	Dashboard (applied jobs, saved jobs, application status).
________________________________________
4. Admin Side (Optional but Recommended)
‚Ä¢	Manage employers and employees (approve/block accounts).
‚Ä¢	Review job postings (approve to prevent scams).
‚Ä¢	Generate reports on employment trends.
‚Ä¢	System monitoring.

üîπ Suggested Tech Stack
‚Ä¢	Frontend:
o	React.js / Vue.js (modern and user-friendly)
o	Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS (fast styling)
‚Ä¢	Backend:
o	Node.js (Express) / Django / Spring Boot (depending on your preference)
o	REST API (for mobile app integration in future)
‚Ä¢	Database:
o	PostgreSQL / MySQL (structured data, relational)
o	Cloud storage (for CVs, certificates) ‚Äì e.g., AWS S3, Firebase, or local storage if small scale
‚Ä¢	Authentication & Security:
o	JWT tokens for login sessions
o	Password hashing (bcrypt)
o	File validation (to prevent malicious uploads)

üëâ Do you want me to create a system design (database schema + basic UI wireframe) for you so you can start implementation, or do you prefer I give you a step-by-step coding prototype (like Django/Node project structure)?
